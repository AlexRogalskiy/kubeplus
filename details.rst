KubePlus API Add-on
=======================

KubePlus API add-on simplifies building Kubernetes-native workflow automation using Kubernetes Custom APIs/ Resources by extending the Kubernetes resource graph and maintaining all implicit and explicit relationships of Custom Resources created through labels, annotations, spec properties or sub-resources. This Custom Resource relationship graph is then used for improved visibility, monitoring and debuggability of workflows. KubePlus API add-on additionally allows you to define workflow level Kubernetes resource dependencies and allows applying security or robustness policies to all the workflow resources together. 

This tool is being developed as a part of our  `Platform as Code practice`_.

Kubernetes Custom Resources and Custom Controllers, popularly known as `Operators`_, extend Kubernetes to run third-party softwares directly on Kubernetes. Teams adopting Kubernetes assemble required Operators of platform softwares such as databases, security, backup etc. to build the required application platforms. KubePlus API add-on simplifies creation of Kubernertes-native platform workflows leveraging these Custom Resources.

The main benefit of using KubePlus to DevOps engineers/application developers are:

- easily discover static and runtime information about Custom Resources available in their cluster.
- aggregate Custom and built-in resources to build secure and robust platform workflows.

KubePlus API Add-on provides discovery commands, binding functions, and an orchestration mechanism to enable DevOps engineers/application developers to define Kubernetes-native platform workflows using Kubernetes Custom and built-in resources.

.. You can think of KubePlus API Add-on as a tool that enables AWS CloudFormation/Terraform like experience when working with Kubernetes Custom Resources.

KubePlus API add-on Components
-------------------------------
KubePlus API add-on is made up of - Platform-as-Code Annotations, client-side kubectl plugins, and server-side components (binding functions and PlatformWorkflow CRD).


Platform-as-Code Resource annotations
--------------------------------------

In order to build and maintain Custom Resource relationship graph, KubePlus API add-on expects CRD packages to be updated with Platform-as-code annotations as described below. 

.. code-block:: bash

   resource/usage

The 'usage' annotation is used to define usage information for a Custom Resource.
The value for 'usage' annotation is the name of the ConfigMap that stores the usage information.

.. code-block:: bash

   resource/composition

The 'composition' annotation is used to define Kubernetes's built-in resources that are created as part of instantiating a Custom Resource instance.


.. code-block:: bash

   resource/annotation-relationship
   resource/label-relationship
   resource/specproperty-relationship

Above annotations are used to declare annotation / label / spec-property based relationships that instances of this Custom Resource can have with other Resources.  

These annotations need to be defined on the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) YAMLs of Operators
in order to make Custom Resources discoverable and usable by application developers.

As an example, annotations on Moodle Custom Resource Definition (CRD) are shown below:

.. code-block:: yaml

  apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
  kind: CustomResourceDefinition
  metadata:
    name: moodles.moodlecontroller.kubeplus
    annotations:
      resource/composition: Deployment, Service, PersistentVolume, PersistentVolumeClaim, Secret, Ingress
      resource/usage: moodle-operator-usage.usage
      resource/specproperty-relationship: "on:INSTANCE.spec.mySQLServiceName, value:Service.spec.metadata.name"
  spec:
    group: moodlecontroller.kubeplus
    version: v1
    names:
      kind: Moodle
      plural: moodles
    scope: Namespaced

The specproperty relationship defines that an instance of Moodle Custom Resource is connected to a Service object through it's mySQLServiceName spec attribute. The value of this attribute the name of a Service object. Below is an example of a Kubernetes-native application workflow in which a Moodle Custom Resource instance is bound to a MysqlCluster Custom Resource instance through the Service object that is created by the MysqlCluster Operator. The specproperty relationship helps discover this relationship as seen below:

.. code-block:: bash

  (venv) Devs-MacBook:kubeplus devdatta$ kubectl connections cr Moodle moodle1 namespace1
  Level:0 kind:Moodle name:moodle1 Owner:/
  Level:1 kind:Service name:cluster1-mysql-master Owner:MysqlCluster/cluster1
  Level:2 kind:Pod name:cluster1-mysql-0 Owner:MysqlCluster/cluster1
  Level:3 kind:Service name:cluster1-mysql-nodes Owner:MysqlCluster/cluster1
  Level:3 kind:Service name:cluster1-mysql Owner:MysqlCluster/cluster1
  Level:2 kind:Pod name:moodle1-5847c6b69c-mtwg8 Owner:Moodle/moodle1
  Level:3 kind:Service name:moodle1 Owner:Moodle/moodle1


Kubectl Plugins
------------------

KubePlus API add-on offers following kubectl plugins towards discovery and use of Custom Resources and obtaining insights into Kubernetes-native application.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ kubectl man cr
   $ kubectl composition cr
   $ kubectl connections cr
   $ kubectl connections service
   $ kubectl metrics cr
   $ kubectl metrics service
   $ kubectl metrics account
   $ kubectl metrics helmrelease
   $ kubectl grouplogs cr
   $ kubectl grouplogs service
   $ kubectl grouplogs helmrelease

In order to use these plugins you need to add KubePlus folder to your PATH variable.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ export KUBEPLUS_HOME=<Full path where kubeplus is cloned>
   $ export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/plugins


Implicit and Explicit Relationships
------------------------------------

Custom Resource relationships can be categorized into two categories. Explicit relationships based on labels/annotations/spec-properties are static and can be hard-coded into Helm charts / YAML files before the deployment. Implicit relationships can not be hard coded pre-deployment and need to be resolved run-time. Example of implicit relationship can be â€“ Restic Custom Resource depends on label on Moodle Custom Resources Deployment sub-resource which gets created only after Moodle resource is created. KubePlus API add-on offers additional functions that can be used directly in the YAML definitions to define such implicit dependencies. 

.. code-block:: bash

   1. Fn::ImportValue(<Parameter>)

This function should be used for defining Custom Resource Spec property values that need to be resolved using runtime information. The function resolves specified parameter at runtime using information about various resources running in a cluster and imports that value into the Spec where the function is defined.

Here is how the ``Fn::ImportValue()`` function can be used in a Custom Resource YAML definition.

.. image:: ./docs/mysql-cluster1.png
   :scale: 10%
   :align: left

.. image:: ./docs/moodle1.png
   :scale: 10%
   :align: right

In the above example the name of the ``Service`` object which is child of ``cluster1`` Custom Resource instance and whose name contains the string ``master`` is discovered at runtime and that value is injected as the value of ``mySQLServiceName`` attribute in the ``moodle1`` Custom Resource Spec.

.. code-block:: bash

   2. Fn::AddLabel(label, <Resource>)

This function adds the specified label to the specified resource by resolving the resource name using runtime information in a cluster.


.. code-block:: bash

   3. Fn::AddAnnotation(annotation, <Resource>)

This function adds the specified annotation to the specified resource by resolving the resource name using runtime information in a cluster.


The ``AddLabel`` and ``AddAnnotation`` functions should be defined as annotations on those Custom Resources that
need appropriate labels and/or annotations on other resources in a cluster for their operation.
`Here`_ is an example of using the ``AddLabel`` function with the ``Restic`` Custom Resource.

.. _Here: https://github.com/cloud-ark/kubeplus/blob/master/examples/platform-crd/moodle-mysql-restic/restic.yaml#L8

Restic Custom Resource takes backups of Deployments. For this, it requires that the Deployment object be given a label.
In order to take backup of Moodle Custom Resource, we need to add a label on its Deployment object. This is
achieved using the ``AddLabel`` function defined as ``pac/action`` annotation on the Restic Custom Resource Spec.


Formal grammar of ``ImportValue``, ``AddLabel``, ``AddAnnotation`` functions is available in the `functions doc`_.

.. _functions doc: https://github.com/cloud-ark/kubeplus/blob/master/docs/kubeplus-functions.txt


Check our `slide deck`_ in the Kubernetes Community Meeting for more details of the above example.


PlatformWorkflow Operator
--------------------------
Creating workflows requires treating the set of resources representing the workflow as a unit. For this purpose, KubePlus provides a Custom Resource of its own - PlatformWorkflow. This Custom Resource enables application developers to define all the resources in a workflow as a unit along with the inter-dependencies between them. The dependency information is used for ensuring robustness and security of the workflows including, preventing out-of-order creation of resources and ensuring that resources that are still in use cannot be deleted. This CRD is being updated to enable applying certain workflow level security or robustness guarantees to all resources involved. 

PlatformWorkflow Operator does not actually deploy any resources defined in a workflow. Resource creation is done by application developers as usual using 'kubectl'.
